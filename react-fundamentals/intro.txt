# React: A JavaScript library to build user interfaces
    - Introduced in 2013 by Facebook (Meta)
    - Declarative library (We need to tell React what to)
    - Advantages of React.js
        - Built on top of JavaScript
    - React is faster than traditional applications
        - Virtual DOM: Copy of the real DOM
            - Real DOM (Document Object Model)
        - Reconciliation: updating the real DOM optimally with only updating the affected nodes
            - Diffing: compare old virtual DOM with new virtual DOM
        - SPA: Single page application
    -  Websites built on React: Facebook, Airbnb, Netflix, Instagram, Asana, Salesforce, Reddit, etc.


    - Setup
        1. Download Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download
            - NPM: Node Package Manager
            - Run:
                - node -v: Node version
                - npm -v: NPM version
        2. Using Vite (Create a react app locally): 
            - npm create vite@latest
            - Give the project a name
            - Framework: choose React
            - Variant: choose JavaScript
            - Use rolldown-vite? No
            - Install with npm and start now? Yes
        3. Enter the folder within the terminal
            - cd (name of folder) react-fundamentals in this case
        4. Start the application
            - If you stop running the app and want to start again, use the command: npm run dev
                - React compiles code and creates a js file understandable by the browser


        - Folder Overview:
            - index.html: Is the only html file in the complete react app
            - src: Source code of React app
                - App.jsx: Parent Component
                - App.css: Styles related to parent component
                - main.jsx: Logic to compile components and add to html root
                - index.css: Global Styles
                - assets: images/assets related to app
            - package.json: Metadata of application

        - Components:
            - Building block of React code
            - Small blocks of code to build parts of UI
            - Features:
                - Can be nested
                - Can be re-used
            - Function component syntax: 
                function Component1() {
                    return(
                        <h1>Test</h1>
                    )
                }
                - Component name should be in PascalCase
                - Components returns jsx
                    - JSX: JavaScript + XML (JavaScript in disguise)
                        - To use variable values/expression results within JSX, use {}
                            - JSX/HTML differences:
                                - use className in JSX for "class" attribute
                                - Singleton tags need mandatory syntax
                                    - <singleton />
                                    - <singleton> </singleton/>
                - To use a component in the parent component
                    - First step: Import it
                    - Syntax:
                        - <Component1 />
                        - <Component1></Component1>
                
                - Props:
                    - Makes components dynamic
                    - Data passed from the parent component to the child component
                    - Syntax:
                     - Pass the prop
                        <Component1 prop1={value1} />

                     - Use the prop
                        function Component1({ prop1 }){
                        return(
                          <h1>Test {prop1}<h1>
                        )
                     } 

                - Render: 
                    - Component loaded in the DOM
                    - JSX converted to HTML
                
                    - React component can have 2 types of data ***
                    
                - Data
                    - props: Data received from parent component
                    - state: Data belonging to that component
                - Rules:
                    - Component re-renders whenever the prop or state changes
                    - State value should only be updated using state handler
